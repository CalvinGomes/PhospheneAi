                <h5 class="blogPhosphene" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="800" data-aos-delay="200">Understanding Artificial Intelligence is hard. But, let’s face it. Modern day A.I is all about reasoning, learning from the environment, identifying patterns and of course, making decisions.  But that’s make brings the most human thing about A.I. It boils down to making computers reason out like ourselves. But as intuitive as it sounds, it’s quite hard to replicate the working of our bodily functions or the brain using the computer. But that’s where all the exciting part lies.</h5>
                <h5 class="blogPhosphene" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="800" data-aos-delay="250">
                    The media generally loves to have a field day when something weird or peculiar study arrives in the research area of A.I. I love having fun with people by scaring them with the stuff that we believe AI could do. But trust me, if that was real, then we could have made A.I cure cancer and HIV by now. Modern day A.I relies on human intelligence but doesn’t work like the way human brains do. But that’s a good thing. We didn’t have to create flapping wings to create Airplanes. Everything that matters is if A.I is able to solve the challenges that we always longed to solve. For eg, Enlitic has tried to identify the way Cancer cells spread without even in-depth knowledge of the algorithms that they used. 
                </h5>
                <h5 class="blogPhosphene" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="800" data-aos-delay="300">
                    At Phosphene.AI, we strongly believe that modern day research in A.I is largely targeted towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), which sounds great, but doesn’t really solve the real-world problems. One such problem is the intrusion of technology in every field present in the world. Don’t take me wrong, but we’ve found a lot of people finding technology as a barrier to creative energies of humans. As hard as it sounds to hear, it is true. No one feels the nostalgia that they felt while writing an article on a piece of paper nowadays. The comfort that I used to feel when I had a pen and paper is nowhere to be felt when the same is done using a keyboard.  
                </h5>                
                <h5 class="blogPhosphene" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="800" data-aos-delay="100">
                    It is this problem that drives us to move forward with our research in A.I. Technology should motivate people to do more. While a large portion of the A.I community focuses mostly on medical research and recommendation systems, we decided to focus on helping creative minds feel home with A.I. Every research at Phosphene A.I is kickstarted with this vision in mind.  
                </h5>
                <h5 class="blogPhosphene" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="800" data-aos-delay="100">
                    I still remember the day when I came up with our first project, PixelView. The idea was totally random. I was just reading some cool articles on AI and when I came across certain wildlife photos being used on certain research papers on Computer Vision. And randomly, aesthetic analysis popped to my mind. Guiding myself with this original vision of wanting to restore the nostalgia of creativity, I came up with the idea of PixelView. It was beautiful process of self realization where I felt that I was suddenly able to relate myself with a product that embodies the original vision. I am no photographer, but the fact that this product will help photographers reduce a lot of time and push themselves to focus on the things that really matter, pumps me up so much. 
                </h5>
                <h5 class="blogPhosphene" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="800" data-aos-delay="100">
                    PixelView is only a part of Phosphene A.I’s original mission. We understand that we have a long way to go. It is quite easy to dismiss the idea of A.I by claiming that it’ll take over the world. Anyone with basic knowledge in AI can easily tell how insane such statements are. We are far behind what we see in the movies and I would even happily claim that we’ll never see such stuff within our life span. However, the future of A.I is quite promising. Irrespective of whether or not it conforms to the definition of Intelligence in the movies, modern day A.I is quite promising and it can really solve some amazing problems that matter.
